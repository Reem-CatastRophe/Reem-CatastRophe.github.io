after unziping the downloaded folder there will be 2 directories and a .py file:

1- face directory --> containes the images to be encoded and trained 

                      make sure that the name of the image is the name of the character to be recognized later
											
2- test directory --> containes the images to be tested 

                      make sure that the extension of the img is jpg
											
                      change the name of the image to be tested in the code then run the program
